# Media Manager (NASA Mars rover image utility)
An open ended utility for downloading images from NASA API. Designed to potentially extend to manage all types of media from a variety of sources.

## Requirements
As stated, the requirements of this utility are,

1. Get input dates from unstructured text documentation
2. Download images from NASA API (starting with Mars Rove) according to input

## Design
Media Manager is a simple utility to download media from provided API. The API service is structured to be extensible to other Nasa API or other RESTful API. Future implementations could use dependency injection to handle CRUD actions (including both uploads and downloads). Media Manager also features a logging service implementing the singleton pattern.

## Dependencies
Media Manager uses Newtonsoft for deserialization of JSON responses.
